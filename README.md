aim to be rewritten as some AGI agent, lazero is intended to collect some util functions as a python package for further use, speed up development and glue with existing AI libraries and AGI algorithms.

the roadmap is as follows:
- collect and rewrite some basic utils
- integrate it with other libraries or projects
- work with AGI related tasks
- serve it and run it freely, without (virtually) any hardware or software limitations
